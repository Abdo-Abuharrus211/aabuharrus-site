My personal website, long overdue...

## Idea
So I've finally got the time and some relevant experience to have a website to convey who I am.
However, this is not about building the flashiest, coolest, most bleeding-edge portfolio project. No.

I'm attempting to learn proper UI/UX design, by following a *"Design first, build later"* mindset. This is why I'm building focusing on simple HTML and styles (CSS) to cultivate my design language.

Later on, I'll likely resort to framework like Next.js or Svelte (Sveltekit) when it grows and a need for dynamic components arises.

## To-do
- [X] Build Welcome Banner.
- [X] Build the Bio.
- [X] Build the Skills conveyor belt.
- [X] Build the Projects gallery.
- [ ] Build Interests and Experiences.
- [X] Build the base layout.
- [X] Build the contact form or section in footer...etc.
- [X] Design data schemas and store data.
- [X] Dynamically render data using components and layouts.
- [X] Combine all layouts and components together.
- [X] Adjust CSS styles for responsiveness on small and medium screens.
- [X] Add some dynamic spice y'know?
- [ ] Design logo.
- [ ] Write the `robots.txt` file
- [ ]
