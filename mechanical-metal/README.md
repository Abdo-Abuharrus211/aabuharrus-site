My personal website, long overdue...

## Idea
So I've finally got the time and some relevant experience to have a website to convey who I am.
However, this is not about building the flashiest, coolest, most bleeding-edge portfolio project. No.

I'm attempting to learn proper UI/UX design, by following a *"Design first, build later"* mindset. This is why I'm building focusing on simple HTML and styles (CSS) to cultivate my design language.

Later on, I'll likely resort to framework like Next.js or Svelte (Sveltekit) when it grows and a need for dynamic components arises.

## To-do
- [ ] Build Welcome Banner
- [ ] Build the Bio
- [ ] Build Interests and Experiences
- [ ] Build the layouts and combine together
- [ ] Design data schemas and store data
- [ ] Dynamically render data using components and layouts
- [ ] Adjust styles for responsiveness
- [ ] Write the `robots.txt` file
- [ ] 



### References & Inspirations
There are countless inspirations going into this project from all over, but here are the stars:

1. Whoissajid ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@whosajid) and [GitHub](https://github.com/whosajid)): his design ethos and informative videos have inspired me greatly when it comes to UI/UX.
2. [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) Wide variety of great and free icons that come in CSS, SVG, and more!
